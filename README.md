# Social Explorer
## Sean Herman && Dan Levine
Social Explorer is an experiment with social APIs. This web app simply groups your Instagram data into geographic clusters, and pairs this data with Twitter data from within that region.

The Twitter "population" within a region represents the total number of friends for users with Tweets within that area. The "president" is the most followed user.
